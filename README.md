## **NPSB**  
  
  The **production** branch contains the 'ready to deliver' , clean code to be reviewed. The code should be ready to run after cloning locally and importing the project in Unity Hub. Github LFS might be needed in order to clone assets fully.  

###  **Game goal:**  
As a user I want to play against a clock counting down. The
gameâ€™s goal is to fill the drunkenness bar to a 100% and do a backflip before the time runs out.

### **Controls:**  
- W A S D - movement  
- Z - change camera  
- Mouse wheel - zoom (only in 'follow' camera)  
- P - Pause
