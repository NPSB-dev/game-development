## **NPSB**  
  
  The **production** branch contains the 'ready to deliver' , clean code to be reviewed.  Start game in ***Main Menu*** scene.  
  The code should be ready to run after cloning locally and importing the project in Unity Hub. **Github LFS** might be needed in order to clone assets fully.  

###  **Game goal:**  
As a user I want to play against a clock counting down. The
gameâ€™s goal is to fill the drunkenness bar to a 100% and do a backflip before the time runs out.

### **Controls:**  
- W A S D - movement  
- Z - change camera  
- Mouse wheel - zoom (only in 'follow' camera)  
- P - Pause  
- E - Interact  
- Esc - Exit in-game
